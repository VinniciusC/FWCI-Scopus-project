## Requirements
* Python 3
* Selenium 
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Scipy
* Full acess at Scopus database


## Collecting the data
Selenium-code.py is the script responsible to collect the data at Scopus.

To get started, it is necessary define some settings filling the variables in the code.

 * scopus_ID\
      Author's ID that can be found in author's page at Scopus\
      Choosing the author number 123456789:
      ```
      scopus_id = '123456789'
      ```
  * ordered_by\
      Specifies the sort that the articles data will be collected\
      Each number represents a sort.\
      1 - All articles\
      2 - Date(Newest)\
      3 - Date(Oldest)\
      4 - Cited by(Highest)\
      5 - Cited by(Lowest)\
      Sorting the articles by the highest citation number:
      ```
      ordered_by = 3
      ```
  * Minimum and maximum years\
      To choose the minimum and maximum year of a publication\
      Fill with 0 to ignore\
      To collect articles published at least in 2000: 
      ```
      min_year = 2000  
      max_year = 0
      ```
   * Size\
      Number of articles to be collected.
      If you choose all articles in sorted_by, fill with 0 and the other options the maximum value is 200.
      To collect 50 articles: 
      ```
      size = 50
      ```
After filling all the variables, it is just necessary run the script:\
    ```
    python Selenium-code.py
    ```
The browser will open and run all the process automatically. \
At the end, the collected data will be written in a CSV file with the following columns and attributes:
| Article_name | FWCI | year | authors_count | Prominence percentile | Topics | Anchors |
|--------------|------|------|---------------|-----------------------|--------|---------|

The file will be saved in author's folder and the name defined by the previously filled variables\
scopus_id_sorted_by_size_min_year_max_year.csv\
After writting, a message of sucess will be shown.\
Observation: sometimes it is necessary to re-execute the code again because of random popups and attributes that were not loaded correctly by the website. We are working in a solution, feel free to contribute.

## Generating graphics and statistics
Using the script graphics-and-statistics.py we can generate graphics and statistics about the previouly collected data.

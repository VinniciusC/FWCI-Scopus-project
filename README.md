## Requirements
* Python 3
* Selenium 
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Scipy
* Full acess at Scopus database


## Collecting the data
Selenium-code.py is the script responsible to collect the data at Scopus.

To get started, it is necessary define some settings filling the variables in the code.

 * scopus_ID\
      Author's ID that can be found in author's page at Scopus\
      Choosing the author number 123456789:
      ```
      scopus_id = '123456789'
      ```
  * ordered_by\
      Specifies the sort that the articles data will be collected\
      Each number represents a sort.\
      1 - All articles\
      2 - Date(Newest)\
      3 - Date(Oldest)\
      4 - Cited by(Highest)\
      5 - Cited by(Lowest)\
      Sorting the articles by the highest citation number:
      ```
      ordered_by = 3
      ```
  * Minimum and maximum years\
      To choose the minimum and maximum year of a publication\
      Fill with 0 to ignore\
      To collect articles published at least in 2000: 
      ```
      min_year = 2000  
      max_year = 0
      ```
   * Size\
      Number of articles to be collected.
      If you choose all articles in sorted_by, fill with 0 and the other options the maximum value is 200.
      To collect 50 articles: 
      ```
      size = 50
      ```
After filling all the variables, it is just necessary run the script:\
    ```
    python Selenium-code.py
    ```
The browser will open and run all the process automatically. \
At the end, the collected data will be written in a CSV file with the following columns and attributes:
| Article_name | FWCI | year | authors_count | Prominence percentile | Topics | Anchors |
|--------------|------|------|---------------|-----------------------|--------|---------|

The file will be saved in author's folder and the name defined by the previously filled variables\
scopus_id_sorted_by_size_min_year_max_year.csv\
After writting, a message of sucess will be shown.\
Observation: sometimes it is necessary to re-execute the code again because of random popups and attributes that were not loaded correctly by the website. We are working in a solution, feel free to contribute.

## Generating graphics and statistics
Using the script graphics-and-statistics.py we can generate graphics and statistics about the previouly collected data.
The graphic represents a count of articles in a specified interval of a chosen attribute. In the following case, the interval is 0.1 and the attribute is Normalized FWCI.

Before using the functions, it is necessary specify the csv path with the data. To this, use the variables file and file2, in case of a second dataset.
Example:
```
file = '/home/user/FWCI-Scopus-project/author1/123456_1_0_2000_0.csv'
```
To use the functions, you need to edit the file calling them with the parameters.

* Graphic with one dataset\
      Function: plot\
      plot(df, title, y,attr)
            * df : The desired dataset. Use df for file and df2 for file2
            * title: The title that will be written on the top of the graphic and the name of the file.
            * y: Name of Y axis
            * attr: Choosen attribute to plot that could be FWCI, authors_count and Prominence percentile
      Example:\
           ```
           plot(df,'Articles count X FWCI', 'Normalized FWCI','FWCI')
           ```

 * Graphic with two dataset\
      Function: plot2\
      plot2(df1, df2, title, legend1, legend2, y, attr)
            - df1 : The desired dataset. Use df for file and df2 for file2
            - df2 : The desired dataset. Use df for file and df2 for file2
            -title: The title that will be written on the top of the graphic and the name of the file.
            -legend1: The legend describing the data at dataset 1
            -legend2: The legend describing the data at dataset 2
            -y: Name of Y axis
            -attr: Choosen attribute to plot that could be FWCI, authors_count and Prominence percentile\
      Example:\
           ```
           plot(df,df2,'20 newest and 20 oldest. Article count x FWCI','Oldest','Newest','FWCI value','FWCI')
           ```
